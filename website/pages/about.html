        <p class="about-title"> What are emissions embodied in trade?</p>
        <p class= "about-paragraph"> When we go to the store and buy goods, these goods are generally made elsewhere, or at least have 
            some components that come from elsewhere. Emissions embodied in trade are all the emissions that had to occur
            in order for this good to be produced, transported, and sold to you. Using multi-regional input-output analysis to evaluate the 
            impacts of the Luxembourgish cattle sector, for example, it is possible to trace the impact of the the soybeans that are grown in Brazil 
            and the corn from the USA that goes into making the animal feed for a Luxembourgish cow.

    <div class="container">
        <p class="about-title"> How are these emissions calculated?</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph"> Emissions embodied in trade are calculated using input-output analysis, an method developed by
            economist Wassily Leontief in the 1930s and '40s (for which he won the Nobel Prize in Economics!). To create environmental input-output databases, researchers 
            start with the economic supply-use tables from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp" target="_blank" id="about-link">System of National Accounts (SNAs) from the United Nations Department of Economic 
            and Social Affairs Statistics Division</a>. These tables are where countries record their exchanges of goods and services per sector,
            which are classified by the International Standard Industrial Classification. These supply-use tables are then modified to create matrices that 
            can correlate expenditure to an environmental impact in the country where it occurs. 
            <br><br>
            By knowing how much we spend on certain items, and by knowing the emission or resource intensity of such items, researchers can put together 
            data tables that link an economic expenditure to an environmental impact. Using input-output analysis, it is possible to track the flow of
            emissions between sectors and countries, and it is a creative method to study the environmental impacts of globalization.
