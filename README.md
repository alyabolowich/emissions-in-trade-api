# API development for consumption-based EU GHG emissions

Discussion regarding climate change and environmental impacts are becoming increasingly frequent in our everyday lives. Have you ever wondered what sectors or countries contribute most to certain impacts? With this API, you can query the impacts that come from different sectors and/or different regions in the EU. With these results, you can get a better idea of what impacts your region produces or consumes the most of and in or to what sector of the economy. 

For API documentation, please refer to the following link: http://api.emissionsintrade.com/v1

This is a two-semester project during my third and fourth semesters in the Bachelor of Computer Science at the Univesity of Luxembourg. 

The API documentation was produced in using HTML, the API in Python (Flask web framework), and the website's business logic was written in Javascript.
